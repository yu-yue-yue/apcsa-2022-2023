	/**
	 * runtime (not necessarily the time a program takes to run): 
	 * 		the number of computations/operations that the algorithm does
	 * 		- you must be more specific about what your computation/operation is
	 * 			ex. swaps, comparisons
	 * problem size: for searching and sorting, the size of the list 
	 * 		- indicates how large the input is 
	 * 
	 * Big-O Notation:
	 * 		models the runtime based on the problem size (n)
	 * 		O(n) is linear 
	 * 			ex. Linear search 
	 * 		O(1) is constant time (this is what we aim for) 
	 * 			ex. accessing in an array
